    // Define a blocking queue
    // Blocking Queue is a threadSafe queue that:
    // Blocks the producer when the queue is full: the producer thread goes to WAITING state. Suspended using Object.wait(), will resume only after a consumer removes an item
    // Blocks the consumer when the queue is empty: the consumer thread goes to WAITING state, once producer add an item, it's notified and resumes operation
    // What happens to API when producer thread is in WAITING state. It might cause starvation in high load situations
    // If queue is full, the thread handling your API request is blocked
    // ------ It does not send a response
    // ------ The client will stay loading (waiting for HTTP response)
    // ------ Can cause thread starvation in high load situations
    // For now we will set a Maximum capacity and use queue.offer() which is non blocking for enqueue operation
